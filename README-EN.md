#  PurpleForge (English)

**PurpleForge** is a long-term, hands-on repository for Purple Teaming — blending offensive techniques (Red Team), defensive detection (Blue Team), and practical integration (Purple Team) into a single, reusable reference platform.

This repository documents techniques like credential theft, lateral movement, misconfigurations, and detection bypasses in a way that's accessible to both red and blue teams — with context from both sides.

## Structure

Each attack or technique is stored in its own folder and includes:
- A single Markdown file (`*.md`) with:
  - What the technique is
  - Red team execution steps
  - Blue team detection methods
  - Purple team insights
  - Hardening and mitigation
- A `/screenshots/` subfolder for visual aids

Central indexes:
- [EN/Index.md](./EN/Index.md) — English Table of Contents
- [JP/目次.md](./JP/目次.md) — Japanese TOC

## Language Support

This repository supports both English and Japanese:
- English documentation is located under `/EN/`
- Japanese documentation is located under `/JP/`

## Topics Covered

- LLMNR Poisoning
- NTLM Relay
- Pass-the-Hash
- Detection Engineering (KQL, Sysmon, Sigma)

- Active Directory Lab Environments

## Goal

This project aims to:
- Provide reusable, realistic purple team examples
- Help defenders understand attacker behavior
- Show how to detect and stop attacks using built-in tools
