# PurpleForge (English)

**PurpleForge** is a long-term, hands-on repository for Purple Teaming — blending offensive techniques (Red Team), defensive detection (Blue Team), and practical integration (Purple Team) into a single, reusable reference platform.

This repository documents techniques like credential theft, lateral movement, misconfigurations, and detection bypasses in a way that's accessible to both red and blue teams — with context from both sides.

### Index File

## Structure
This repository is organized into clearly separated sections, each covering a core aspect of Purple Teaming — from environment setup and attack simulation to automation, detection engineering, and incident response.

All materials are documented in Markdown and include configurations, analysis steps, and visuals where applicable.
Each section can be used independently or as part of a larger end-to-end workflow.

## Language Support

This repository supports both English and Japanese:
- English documentation is located under `/EN/`
- Japanese documentation is located under `/JP/`

## Topics Covered

- End-to-end attack simulations (e.g. phishing to ransomware)
- Credential access and lateral movement techniques
- Blue team detection strategies (Sysmon, Sigma, EQL)
- Threat intelligence enrichment and correlation
- Security automation using SOAR and playbooks
- Incident response and containment workflows
- Integration of LLMs for decision support and tuning
- Active Directory lab infrastructure and misconfigurations

## Goal

This project aims to:
- Demonstrate practical purple teaming workflows
- Help analysts understand attacker behavior through hands-on replication
- Provide detection and hardening guidance tied to real scenarios
- Serve as a reference lab for SOC operations, IR training, and tooling validation
- Explore automation and AI-assisted decision-making in incident response
