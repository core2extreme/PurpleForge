# PurpleForge

Welcome to **PurpleForge** — a long-term, hands-on Purple Teaming repository focused on Red, Blue, and Purple team knowledge sharing.

This repository includes attack simulations, detection engineering, and hardening techniques — all structured in a clean, repeatable lab format.

## Lab Philosophy: Enterprise-Grade Purple Team Simulation

This lab environment is designed to reflect realistic enterprise conditions, not simplified proof-of-concept scenarios.
The architecture emulates multi-zone network segmentation, dual-firewall infrastructure, and cross-functional detection-response workflows.

Unlike general-purpose testbeds or pentesting sandboxes, this lab focuses on:

Adversary emulation across DMZ, internal, and restricted networks

Detection engineering with full event visibility and timeline correlation

SOAR-driven containment workflows including VLAN-based isolation

Integration of threat intelligence for real-time enrichment and response logic

Role-based assets with specific attack surfaces, functions, and trust levels

LLM-assisted detection or decision support, tested in live IR conditions

This is not a single-network, catch-all lab.
Instead, PurpleForge simulates the challenges and workflows encountered in modern enterprise SOCs, including incident containment, policy enforcement, and cross-zone automation.

To further align with realistic environments, future expansions will include Zero Trust architecture components, multi-factor authentication (MFA) integration, and additional layers of identity-aware access control.

The goal is to build, test, and refine security processes, not just to demonstrate tool capabilities.
